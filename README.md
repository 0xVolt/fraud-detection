# Fraud Detection
A minor project in machine learning.
## Problem Statement
According to the Data Breach Index, more than 5 million records are being stolen on a daily
basis, a concerning statistic that shows - fraud is still very common both for Card-Present and
Card-not Present type of payments.
In todayâ€™s digital world where trillions of Card transaction happens per day, detection of fraud
is challenging. As fraudster change tactics, learning algorithm can be improvised adding more
analyzed features
As a data scientist, you are required to construct a ML model based on the available data and
justify how mature your model is for industry (bank- payment gateways or VISA / Mastercard)
in categorization & authorization of transaction based on efficiency in fraud detection.
- Explore other performance characteristics like accuracy, specificity, the area under the
precision-recall curve, confusion matrix etc. on the given dataset.
- Identify all possible features critical in the identification of card frauds.
